# What's New?

### Abstract

This application was built with `create-react-app`.  This app is used to display news article cards that include the headline, a brief description, a related image, and a link to access that article if the user would like to read more.  The user can filter the articles being displayed by topic category, and from the current articles being displayed the user can further filter the articles using the search bar to find articles matching the text they input.  I plan on further developing this app in the future so that it can retrieve and display articles from a fetch API so that the articles available to the user are more updated and recent.
