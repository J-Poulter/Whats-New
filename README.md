# What's New?

### Abstract

This application was built with `create-react-app`.  This app is used to display news article cards that include the headline, a brief description, a related image, and a link to access that article if the user would like to read more.  The user can filter the articles being displayed by topic category, and from the current articles being displayed the user can further filter the articles using the search bar to find articles matching the text they input.  I plan on further developing this app in the future so that it can retrieve and display articles from a fetch API so that the articles available to the user are more updated and recent.

### Visual Demonstration of App in Use

Here we can see a general overview of the app.  The user is scrolling through the various articles displayed from the start and clicks one of the links to access that particular article.

In this next demonstration, we see the user make use of the navigation bar on the left.  As the user clicks on each topic category, the app filters out and displays articles that match the category.

Here we see the user make sure of the search bar located at the top.  The user inputs the words they want to search for and after hitting enter or clicking the search now button, it filters the displayed articles by those that have headlines which include the searched text.

Click the green button 'Clone or Download' and copy the http: address listed.  Next, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you would like the app located.  Type 'git clone' followed by a space and then pasting the address you copied previously.  Once this is completed, navigate into the directory and run npm install.  After it's done with that you can run npm start and it will automatically open a react app website where you can use the app.
